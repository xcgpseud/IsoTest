Welcome to my submission!

I'd like to quickly note that I've commented on here WAY more than I usually would, for the purposes of this being a test.

I am a strong believer that comments should only say "why" and not "what" - reading the code should tell you what it does!

I enjoyed this test and hope I've managed to keep to the spec.

There are a few things I would change given more time but I didn't want to overdo it.

Thanks!
